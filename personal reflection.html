   <h2 class="h2">Faith, integrity, and responsible digital citizenship are important values that guide me every day. 
      Faith helps me stay strong, hopeful, and positive, even when things get hard.
       It reminds me that I am not alone and that I should always try to do what is good and right.
        My faith inspires me to treat others with kindness and to be thankful for what I have.</h2>

   <h2 class="h2">Integrity means being honest and doing the right thing, even when no one is watching. 
      I believe that having integrity builds trust and respect. 
      When I make choices, I try to think about how they will affect others.
      I want people to know that they can rely on me, and that I stand by my words and actions.</h2>

   <section>
      <h2 class="h2">As a student and as a person living in a digital world, I also need to practice responsible digital citizenship.
          This means using the internet wisely and safely.I should respect others online, avoid sharing false information, and protect my personal details. 
          I also need to think before I click, post, or comment, because what I do online can affect others and can stay there forever.</h1>

   <section>
      <h2 class="h2">In my life, I want these three values—faith, integrity, and digital responsibility—to guide my decisions. 
         By living with faith, staying honest, and being careful online, I can grow into a better person and contribute to a safer and kinder community.</h1>
